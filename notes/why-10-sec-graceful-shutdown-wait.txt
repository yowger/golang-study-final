The 10-second timeout in the graceful shutdown process is a safety mechanism to ensure the server shuts down cleanly within a reasonable amount of time, even if some operations are still ongoing. Here's why this approach is used:

---

### **1. Why Wait 10 Seconds for Graceful Shutdown?**

- **Graceful Shutdown Basics:**  
  Graceful shutdown means the server stops accepting new requests while allowing in-flight requests (ongoing requests) to complete. This ensures no data is lost or corrupted during shutdown.

- **Purpose of 10-Second Timeout:**  
  - Allows enough time for ongoing HTTP requests or background tasks (e.g., database writes, file uploads) to finish.
  - Prevents the server from hanging indefinitely if some requests or tasks never complete (e.g., due to a deadlock or bug).
  - Balances between clean shutdown and quick recoveryâ€”10 seconds is generally considered reasonable for most applications.

- **Default Duration:**  
  The 10 seconds is arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the needs of your application:
  - **Longer Timeout:** Use this if your application handles long-running tasks, such as video processing or large database transactions.
  - **Shorter Timeout:** Use this for applications with fast, stateless requests where ongoing tasks can be quickly terminated.

---

### **2. What Happens During the Timeout?**

- The server stops accepting new requests (via `e.Shutdown(ctx)`).
- It waits for all ongoing requests to finish.
- If all tasks complete before the timeout, the server shuts down immediately.
- If the timeout elapses before all tasks complete:
  - The `Shutdown` function forcibly stops the server and remaining tasks may be interrupted.

---

### **3. Adjusting the Timeout**

You can modify the timeout depending on your specific application needs:

- **Shorter Timeout:**  
  Use a lower timeout for lightweight applications where long-running requests are rare.

  ```go
  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
  ```

- **Dynamic Timeout:**  
  Set the timeout based on the current workload or task types (e.g., longer for tasks involving database operations).

---

### **4. What If You Don't Wait?**

If you don't use a timeout or skip the graceful shutdown altogether:

- **In-Flight Requests Are Dropped:**  
  Requests currently being processed will be aborted, potentially leading to:
  - Data loss or corruption.
  - Interrupted user experience (e.g., partial file uploads).
  
- **Resources May Be Leaked:**  
  Open database connections, file handles, or other system resources may remain open, causing memory or resource leaks.

---

### **5. Real-World Example**

Imagine an e-commerce app:

- During shutdown, a user places an order while the database is writing their transaction.
- Without graceful shutdown:  
  - The request is interrupted, leaving the transaction incomplete. The user might be charged, but the order isn't placed.

- With graceful shutdown (10-second timeout):  
  - The server completes the transaction within the timeout and cleanly stops once all requests are done.

---

### **Summary**

- The **10-second timeout** ensures all ongoing requests and tasks complete without indefinite delay.
- Adjust it based on your application's behavior.
- Skipping graceful shutdown risks data loss, corrupted states, and resource leaks.
