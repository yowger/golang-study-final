When you print `users` directly in this line:

```go
fmt.Println("users: ", users)
```

The output appears as "random numbers" because `users` is a map, and when you print a map directly, Go's default `fmt` behavior outputs the map's memory address representation for its values. This is why you see output like:

```
users: map[1:0xc0000a0020]
```

Here, `0xc0000a0020` is the memory address of the `user` struct stored in the map.

### Solution: Print the Actual Data
To print the actual data, you need to iterate through the map and format the output to show the fields of the `user` struct.

#### Example of Printing the Real Data
```go
fmt.Println("users: ")
for id, user := range users {
    fmt.Printf("ID: %d, Name: %s\n", id, user.Name)
}
```

This will output something like:
```
users: 
ID: 1, Name: John Doe
ID: 2, Name: Jane Smith
```

### Why Iterate Through the Map?
Maps in Go store values by reference (in this case, pointers to the `user` struct), and printing the map directly doesn't automatically dereference those pointers. Iterating through the map allows you to access and print the actual data in the struct.

### Alternative: Use `json.MarshalIndent` for Pretty Printing
If you want to print the entire `users` map as a JSON-like structure:

```go
import "encoding/json"

data, _ := json.MarshalIndent(users, "", "  ")
fmt.Println("users: ", string(data))
```

This will output something like:
```json
users: {
  "1": {
    "ID": 1,
    "Name": "John Doe"
  },
  "2": {
    "ID": 2,
    "Name": "Jane Smith"
  }
}
```

This approach is especially useful for debugging, as it gives a clear and human-readable representation of the data.
