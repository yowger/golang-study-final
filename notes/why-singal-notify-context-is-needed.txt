Here's an explanation of your concerns:

---

### **Why does the server stop if you don't use `signal.NotifyContext`?**

If you don't use `signal.NotifyContext` (or any mechanism to wait for system signals or handle shutdown gracefully), your program will stop **immediately** after the `main` function completes. 

In the example above:

1. Without `signal.NotifyContext` or any blocking operation after launching the server in a goroutine, the `main` function ends after `fmt.Println("START THIS SERVER BABY!")`.
2. When the `main` function ends, the Go runtime terminates the program, including any running goroutines (like your server).

The `signal.NotifyContext` blocks execution with `<-ctx.Done()`, keeping the program alive until a termination signal (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) is received.

---

### **Does `signal.NotifyContext` keep the server running?**

Yes, indirectly. `signal.NotifyContext` doesn't keep the server running by itself but ensures that your **main thread** is blocked until a termination signal (like `os.Interrupt` or `SIGTERM`) is received.

- The server keeps running because `e.Start` is running inside a **goroutine**.
- `<-ctx.Done()` keeps the **main thread** alive, waiting for the signal. This prevents the program from exiting and terminating all goroutines prematurely.

---

### **Is a goroutine the same as a thread?**

No, but they are related concepts:

1. **Goroutine:**
   - A goroutine is a lightweight, managed thread in Go. 
   - The Go runtime handles scheduling goroutines across available OS threads.
   - Goroutines are more memory-efficient and faster to create than OS threads.

2. **Thread:**
   - A thread is a lower-level concept managed by the operating system.
   - Threads are used to execute tasks concurrently, but they are heavier and less flexible than goroutines.

When you use `go func() { e.Start(...) }`, you're creating a goroutine that runs on an underlying OS thread managed by the Go runtime.

---

### **Why does `<-ctx.Done()` matter?**

The `<-ctx.Done()` statement makes the main thread wait for the context to be "done," which happens when:

1. A signal like `os.Interrupt` (from `Ctrl+C`) is received.
2. You manually call `stop()` (the deferred cancel function).

Without it, the main function would exit, and the program would terminate, killing all running goroutines, including your server.

---

### **Summary**

- **`signal.NotifyContext`** listens for OS signals (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) and ensures the main thread blocks until the signal is received, keeping the program alive.
- The server runs in a **goroutine**, but the **main thread** must remain alive to keep the server running.
- `<-ctx.Done()` keeps the main thread alive by blocking it until the termination signal is received.
- Goroutines are lightweight abstractions managed by Go, not the OS, while threads are managed by the OS.
